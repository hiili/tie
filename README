The Incredible Environment (TIE) is an interactive virtual reality system with
realistic physics modeling. The system is implemented as a C++ library which
offers the avatar classes and some commonly needed object types to be used in
the virtual environment. Beside these it is possible to create and use objects
created directly with the underlying Lifespace Simulator platform. This program
package includes also a demo world called the Improbable Mission.
