Fluid plugin for Lifespace Simulator
-----------------------------------------

Compiling and installing:

Prerequisites:
  - You have to have the Lifespace Simulator installed somewhere and the
    environment variable LIFESPACE_BASE_DIR set to point to the installation
    directory (the directory that contains the lifespace's include and lib
    dirs).
  - VR Juggler is also needed and the VJ_BASE_DIR must point to its
    installation directory.

Compiling and installing the plugin:
  - Enter 'make' (must be gnu make) in the plugins/ directory.
  - Copy the contents of the newly created include/ and lib/ directories into
    the Lifespace installation directory (while maintaining their internal
    directory structure):
      cp -R include/lifespace/plugins $LIFESPACE_BASE_DIR/include/lifespace
      cp -R lib/liblifespacefluid.a $LIFESPACE_BASE_DIR/lib

Generating the reference manual:
  - Type 'doxygen Doxyfile_user' in the plugins/ dir to generate a user
    reference manual. Lifespace Simulator must be installed at this point (or
    you can remove manually the LIFESPACE_BASE_DIR reference from the
    Doxyfile).
  - Type 'doxygen Doxyfile_devel' in the plugins/ dir to generate a developer
    reference manual. Lifespace Simulator must be installed at this point (or
    you can remove manually the LIFESPACE_BASE_DIR reference from the
    Doxyfile).

Tests and examples:
  - More information about these can be found from the directories test/ and
    examples/.
